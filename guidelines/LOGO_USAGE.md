# Pica Logo Usage Guidelines

## Logo Versions

### Primary Logo
The primary Pica logo should be used in most contexts. Available in:
- `assets/logos/pica-logo-primary.svg` - Full color
- `assets/logos/pica-logo-primary.png` - Full color (raster)

### Monochrome Versions
For single-color applications:
- `assets/logos/pica-logo-white.svg` - White version for dark backgrounds
- `assets/logos/pica-logo-black.svg` - Black version for light backgrounds

### Icon Only
For small spaces or app icons:
- `assets/logos/pica-icon.svg` - Icon mark only

## Clear Space

Always maintain adequate clear space around the logo to ensure visibility and impact.

```
Minimum clear space = Height of logo × 0.25 on all sides
```

## Minimum Size

To ensure legibility, the logo should not be displayed smaller than:
- **Full logo**: 100px width (digital) / 25mm (print)
- **Icon only**: 24px (digital) / 6mm (print)

## Background Usage

### Approved Backgrounds
- White or light neutral backgrounds (Gray 100)
- Pica Blue background (use white logo)
- Dark backgrounds (use white logo)
- Photography (ensure sufficient contrast)

### Backgrounds to Avoid
- Busy patterns that reduce legibility
- Colors that clash with brand colors
- Low-contrast situations

## Logo Don'ts

- Do not stretch or distort the logo
- Do not rotate the logo
- Do not change logo colors outside of approved versions
- Do not add effects (shadows, gradients, outlines)
- Do not place the logo on low-contrast backgrounds
- Do not crop or partially obscure the logo
- Do not rearrange logo elements
- Do not use outdated logo versions

## Co-Branding

When using the Pica logo alongside partner logos:
- Maintain equal visual weight
- Use appropriate clear space between logos
- Separate with a vertical line if needed
- Ensure both logos are clearly legible
